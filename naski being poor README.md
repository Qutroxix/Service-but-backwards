 ## Overview: 
This script creates a custom GUI for Roblox that includes features such as:

Tabs: Goal, Whitelist, and Credits.

Whitelist System: Dynamically add or remove players from a whitelist and show them in a scrollable frame.

Goal Display: A section to display the current goal or task.

Credits Section: Display information about the script creator.


The script ensures that the GUI loads only after the game has fully loaded, providing a smooth user experience. It also dynamically handles adding/removing whitelisted players, updating the UI accordingly.

Features

Tabs: Goal, Whitelist, and Credits for organizing the script's functions.

Whitelist Management: Players can be added or removed from the whitelist with a smooth UI update.

Scroll Functionality: The whitelist tab has a scrollable list for easy navigation.

Goal Section: A customizable goal display that can show in-game objectives or tasks.

Credits Section: Displays creator information (naski) and their Discord handle.

Compact and Efficient GUI: The GUI is designed to be minimalistic, ensuring it doesn't take up too much space but still retains all necessary features.

2. How to Use:

The GUI will automatically load after the player joins and will not lag during the loading process.

Whitelisted players will appear in the whitelist section. Players can be added to the whitelist using the addPlayerToWhitelist function.

The Goal tab will display the current goal, and the Credits tab will show creator details.

The whitelist system updates dynamically as players are added or removed.

Poor Naski Section (aka Me)

Ah yes, the poor soul behind this script, Naski, who is constantly battling the endless woes of life in Roblox scripting. Despite working tirelessly on this script and providing it for free, Naski still struggles with the eternal problem of not enough Roblox Robux to buy all those shiny new items in the catalog.

Every night, Naski spends countless hours tinkering with code, trying to make everything work perfectly, but alas, there's always something new to fix. But don't worry, even though Naski's financial situation might be a bit tight (due to being "poor"), Naski's passion for Roblox scripting and creating awesome experiences never fades.

Please, if you like this script, remember to give a thumbs up or a positive comment—every bit helps Naski feel like they’re doing something right. After all, a little support goes a long way. If you ever feel like donating some Robux (for the cause), Naski’s Discord is available for all your generous offerings.

Naski’s Discord: naskiiii

We all have our struggles, and sometimes we just need a little reminder that we're not alone. Remember, every line of code comes with its own set of challenges—but we keep pushing forward! Let's all be a little kinder and support each other in this massive community of creators.
